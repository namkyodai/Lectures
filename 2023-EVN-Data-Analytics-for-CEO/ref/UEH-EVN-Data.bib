Basic concepts and the procedures of the typical data analytics for general problems are also discussed. The advanced applications of different data analytics in smart grids are addressed as the main part of this paper. By dealing with huge amount of data from electricity network, meteorological information system, geographical information system etc., many benefits can be brought to the existing power system and improve the customer service as well as the social welfare in the era of big data.

This paper describes a forecasting methodology that explores a set of different sparse structures for the vector autoregression (VAR) model using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) framework. The alternating direction method of multipliers is applied to fit the different LASSO-VAR variants and create a scalable forecasting method supported by parallel computing and fast convergence, which can be used by system operators and renewable power plant operators. A test case with 66 wind power plants is used to show the improvement in forecasting skill from exploring distributed sparse structures. The proposed solution outperformed the conventional autoregressive and vector autoregressive models, as well as a sparse VAR model from the state of the art.

  abstract = {Wind power forecasts with lead times of up to a few hours are essential to the optimal and economical operation of power systems and markets. Vector autoregression (VAR) is a framework that has been shown to be well suited to predicting for several wind farms simultaneously by considering the spatio-temporal dependencies in their time series. Lasso penalisation yields sparse models and can avoid overfitting the large numbers of coefficients in higher dimensional settings. However, estimation in VAR models usually does not account for changes in the spatio-temporal wind power dynamics that are related to factors such as seasons or wind farm setup changes, for example. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a time-adaptive lasso estimator and an efficient coordinate descent algorithm for updating the VAR model parameters recursively online. The approach shows good abilities to track changes in the multivariate time series dynamics on simulated data. Furthermore, in two case studies it shows clearly better predictive performances than the non-adaptive lasso VAR and univariate autoregression.},

This target could bring renewable energy resources technologies closer to the ‘Smart Energy Communities’; that would allow the active participation of the so-called ׳prosumers׳ in a genuinely open market. Accordingly, there is a need to develop strategies to motivate and involve citizens in the future electricity system. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an important role to play in reducing the energy intensity and therefore increasing the energy efficiency of the economy, contributing to sustainable growth. The emphasis of the smart grid in social media through mobile apps could give utilities a collection of new instruments to improve their customer engagement. To preserve long-term customer fidelity, utilities should transform themselves from energy suppliers to energy service advisor. Utilities can draw useful lessons from most valuable brands on how to expand their digital customer experience initiatives. Therefore, this paper discusses and offers guidance for utilities in creating a social roadmap for the smart grid, emphasizing prosumer role.},

This is an indication that combining advanced structures or the corresponding forecasts from both modeling approaches can bring a further improvement in forecasting accuracy. We show that this indeed can be the case, even for a simple averaging scheme involving only two models. Finally, we also analyze variable selection for the best performing high-dimensional lasso-type models, thus provide guidelines to structuring better performing forecasting model designs.},

  abstract = {Weather is a major driving factor of electricity demand. The selection of weather station(s) plays a vital role in electric load forecasting. Nevertheless, minimal research efforts have been devoted to weather station selection. In the smart grid era, hierarchical load forecasting, which provides load forecasts throughout the utility system hierarchy, is emerging as an important topic. Since there are many nodes to forecast in the hierarchy, it is no longer feasible for forecasting analysts to figure out the best weather stations for each node manually. A commonly used solution framework involves assigning the same number of weather stations to all nodes at the same level of the hierarchy. This framework was also adopted by all four of the winning teams of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012 (GEFCom2012) in the hierarchical load forecasting track. In this paper, we propose a weather station selection framework to determine how many and which weather stations to use for a territory of interest. We also present a practical, transparent and reproducible implementation of the proposed framework. We demonstrate the application of the proposed approach to the forecasting of electricity at different levels in the hierarchies of two US utilities. One of them is a large US generation and transmission cooperative that has deployed the proposed framework. The other one is from GEFCom2012. In both case studies, we compare our unconstrained approach with four other alternatives based on the common practice mentioned above. We show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by removing the constraint on the fixed number of weather stations.},

  abstract = {Temperature plays a key role in driving the electricity demand. We adopt the “recency effect”, a term drawn from psychology, to represent the fact that the electricity demand is affected by the temperatures of the preceding hours. In the load forecasting literature, the temperature variables are often constructed in the form of lagged hourly temperatures and moving average temperatures. In the past, computing power has limited the amount of temperature variables that can be used in a load forecasting model. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study to model the recency effect using a big data approach. We take advantage of modern computing power to answer a fundamental question: how many lagged hourly temperatures and/or moving average temperatures are needed in a regression model in order to capture the recency effect fully without compromising the forecasting accuracy? Using a case study based on data from the load forecasting track of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2012, we first demonstrate that a model with the recency effect outperforms its counterpart (a.k.a. Tao’s Vanilla Benchmark Model) by 18% to 21% for forecasting the load series at the top (aggregated) level. We then model the recency effect in order to customize load forecasting models at the bottom level of a geographic hierarchy, again showing a superiority over the benchmark model of 12% to 15% on average. Finally, we discuss four different implementations of the recency effect modeling by hour of a day. In addition, this paper also presents two interesting findings: 1) the naive models are not useful for benchmark purposes in load forecasting at aggregated level due to their lack of accuracy; and 2) slicing the data into 24 pieces to develop one model for each hour is not necessarily better than building one interaction regression model using all 24 hours together.},

  abstract = {As the healthcare industry continues to generate a massive amount of medical data, healthcare organizations integrate data-driven insights into their clinical and operational processes to enhance the quality of healthcare services. Our preliminary hospital clustering analysis (Albarakati and Obradovic, in The IEEE 29th international symposium on computer-based medical systems (CBMS), IEEE, 2017) studied hospitals monthly admission behavior for different diseases. Results showed consistent behavior when disease symptoms similarity is considered. This study extends our preliminary work to include other aspects of disease data and the fusion of different views of disease data. It is an original approach that tackles clustering complex networks using a combination of multi-view and multi-domain clustering models while imposing data on the clustering goal from both medical and non-medical domains simultaneously. The objective of the study is to determine the effect of disease networks on characterizing the underlying clustering structure of 145 disease-specific hospital networks, each consisting of up to 152 hospitals. This is achieved by extracting two different views of disease networks. One disease network view based on similarity of symptom profiles was extracted from a 20 million medical bibliographic literature records. Another disease network view based on monthly hospitalization distribution was extracted from over 7 million discharge records data obtained from the California State Inpatient Database for years 2009-2011. Patient admission records included both medical and sociodemographic information. These multiple views were analyzed separately and were also integrated in a joint model that combined the two views. It is shown that the fusion of multi-view disease networks of monthly hospitalization distributions explained the hidden common structure shared among multiple hospital-specific disease networks. The group homogeneity measures for obtained hospital clusters ranged between 33 and 60% with average close to 50%. However, integrating multiple views of disease networks extracted from different domains, i.e., from literature and medical databases, better revealed the underlying clustering structure of disease-specific hospital networks. The group homogeneity measures for this multi-domain setting ranged between 38 and 76% with average close to 60%.},

  abstract = {Data-driven phenotype discoveries on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data have recently drawn benefits across many aspects of clinical practice. In the method described in this paper, we map a very large EHR database containing more than a million inpatient cases into a low dimensional space where diseases with similar phenotypes have similar representation. This embedding allows for an effective segmentation of diseases into more homogeneous categories, an important task of discovering disease types for precision medicine. In particular, many diseases have heterogeneous nature. For instance, sepsis, a systemic and progressive inflammation, can be caused by many factors, and can have multiple manifestations on different human organs. Understanding such heterogeneity of the disease can help in addressing many important issues regarding sepsis, including early diagnosis and treatment, which is of huge importance as sepsis is one of the main causes of in-hospital deaths in the United States. This study analyzes state of the art embedding models that have had huge success in various fields, applying them to disease embedding from EHR databases. Particular interest is given to learning multi-type representation of heterogeneous diseases, which leads to more homogeneous groups. Our results show evidence that such representations have phenotypes of higher quality and also provide benefit when predicting mortality of inpatient visits.},

  abstract = {Bayesian belief networks provide a natural, efficient method for representing probabilistic dependencies among a set of variables. For these reasons, numerous researchers are exploring the use of belief networks as a knowledge representation in artificial intelligence. Algorithms have been developed previously for efficient probabilistic inference using special classes of belief networks. More general classes of belief networks, however, have eluded efforts to develop efficient inference algorithms. We show that probabilistic inference using belief networks is NP-hard. Therefore, it seems unlikely that an exact algorithm can be developed to perform probabilistic inference efficiently over all classes of belief networks. This result suggests that research should be directed away from the search for a general, efficient probabilistic inference algorithm, and toward the design of efficient special-case, average-case, and approximation algorithms.},
